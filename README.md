# Hi, I am Adam 👋

I am software developer who enjoys building apps and working on puzzles 

A few things that I have done:

- ⭐ Built the [Hall of Taps](https://adammcintosh.github.io/The-Hall-of-Taps/).
- 🛠️ Built an [MCP server for Cursor](https://github.com/AdamMcIntosh/roland).
- 🌹⚡ Built [Daily Dead Dose](https://github.com/AdamMcIntosh/DeadDailyDose) A Windows desktop app for your daily dose of Grateful Dead–era live music. Pick an artist, get a show of the day from the Internet Archive, view the setlist (when configured), and play the show’s tracks. You can find a web version [here](https://adammcintosh.github.io/DeadDailyDose/)

In the past I've updated an API and documented for [Untappd](https://github.com/AdamMcIntosh/Untappd.Net)
