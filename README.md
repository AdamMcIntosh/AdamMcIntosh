# Hi, I am Adam 👋

A few things that I do:

- 🌹⚡ Built [Daily Dead Dose](https://github.com/AdamMcIntosh/DeadDailyDose) A Windows desktop app for your daily dose of Grateful Dead–era live music. Pick an artist, get a show of the day from the Internet Archive, view the setlist (when configured), and play the show’s tracks.

In the past I've updated an API and documented for [Untappd](https://github.com/AdamMcIntosh/Untappd.Net)
